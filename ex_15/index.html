        <p>People and music is all that I need.</p>
        <p>Mathias Kom of Canadian indie band The Burning Hell wrote those words during the first week of coronavirus lockdown. He released the song — titled “I Want To Drink In A Bar” — on BandCamp on May 1 as a fundraiser to help venues stay open.</p>
        <p>As Saskatchewan’s COVID-19 restrictions slowly and methodically let up, the wishful thinking of Kom’s song is becoming a reality: We can drink in bars now, two-metres-distanced from other people, our hands freshly sanitized and our servers hygienically masked.</p>
        <p>But, so far, the soundtrack is pre-recorded; live music remains elusive.</p>
        <p>“We aren’t allowed to do any entertainment, but we would love to,” said Kelly Cairns, one of four staff co-owners of Regina restaurant and venue The Cure.</p>
